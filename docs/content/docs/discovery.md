description: Automatic image discovery with DiscoveryPolicy.
llmsDescription: |
  DiscoveryPolicy CRD enables automatic image discovery using a three-stage pipeline:
  queries → signals → ranking. Referenced by CachedImageSet via discoveryPolicyRef.
  Discovered images are materialized as CachedImage resources. Supports filtering,
  time-weighted scoring, weighted ranking, and periodic re-discovery.
---

DiscoveryPolicy discovers images from external sources. CachedImageSet consumes the discovered list and materializes CachedImage resources.

## Why This Exists

Discovery came from operational pain:

- CI bursts created pull storms where many nodes pulled the same large images at once
- Registry rate limits and transient outages amplified cold-start latency
- Hand-maintained image lists became stale and missed newly hot images
- Node rotation (e.g. Cluster API MachineDeployments rolling new nodes daily or weekly) means fresh nodes start with empty image caches — every rotation triggers a full re-pull of all active images

DiscoveryPolicy continuously refreshes image candidates from usage signals and passes the ranked output to CachedImageSet.

## How Discovery Works

![DiscoveryPolicy pipeline: queries feed signals, signals feed a single ranking strategy, the ranked list is written to status.discoveredImages and consumed by CachedImageSet to create CachedImage resources that nodes pull.](/images/discovery-pipeline.drawio.svg)

Queries feed signals, signals feed a single ranking strategy, and the ranked list is written to `status.discoveredImages` — consumed by CachedImageSet to create CachedImage resources that nodes pull.

| Stage | Purpose | Available types |
|-------|---------|-----------------|
| Queries | Fetch raw observations from a backend | `prometheus` · `loki` · `registry` |
| Signals | Reduce a query series to one value per image | `aggregate` · `timeWeightedAggregate` · `windowAggregate` · `eventPullTime` |
| Ranking | Order images into the final list | `signal` · `weightedSum` · `modelExposure` |

The output lands in `status.discoveredImages`; CachedImageSet reads it and creates/deletes `CachedImage` children that nodes pull.

## Stage 1 — Queries

A query fetches raw observations and is referenced by name from signals.

All snippets below are complete `DiscoveryPolicy` resources with minimal companion
signals/ranking so you can apply them directly.

| Type | Source | Discovered from | Use when |
|------|--------|-----------------|----------|
| `prometheus` | Metrics series | `image` label on results | Usage/concurrency from cluster metrics |
| `loki` | Event logs | parsed pull events | Pull durations & image sizes |
| `registry` | Tag/catalog API | repository tags | Pre-cache newest tags by name |

### Prometheus Query

**Definition.** Runs a PromQL query against any Prometheus-compatible API and turns each returned series into a candidate image. The result **must** have an `image` label — that value becomes the image reference.

#### How it's used in the CRD

```yaml
apiVersion: drop.corewire.io/v1alpha1
kind: DiscoveryPolicy
metadata:
  name: prometheus-query-example
spec:
  syncInterval: 1h            # how often the whole pipeline re-runs
  maxImages: 30               # keep only the top 30 ranked images
  # STAGE 1: fetch raw data
  queries:
    - name: runner-image-usage   # unique id; referenced by signals[].query
      type: prometheus
      prometheus:
        endpoint: https://mimir.example.com   # any Prometheus-compatible API
        queryType: range        # range = samples over time | instant = single point
        lookback: 168h          # look back 7 days (range queries only)
        step: 1m                # smaller step = more samples + more backend load
        query: |
          # Result must expose an image label — Discovery keys every image by it.
          count(
            container_memory_working_set_bytes{
              container!="", container!="POD",
              namespace="gitlab-runner", pod=~"runner-.*"
            }
          ) by (image)
  # STAGE 2: reduce the series to one number per image
  signals:
    - name: total-usage         # signal name, referenced by ranking below
      query: runner-image-usage  # which query's data to consume
      type: aggregate
      aggregate:
        method: sum             # sum all samples = total activity per image
  # STAGE 3: order the images
  ranking:
    strategy: signal
    signal: total-usage         # sort purely by the total-usage signal
```

#### What happens to our query

`... by (image)` makes Prometheus return one time series per image. A `range` query samples each series across `lookback`, one point every `step`. Discovery reads the raw response:

```json
{
  "data": { "result": [
    { "metric": { "image": "img-A" }, "values": [[t0, "1"], [t1, "2"], [t2, "6"]] },
    { "metric": { "image": "img-B" }, "values": [[t1, "1"], [t2, "3"]] }
  ]}
}
```

We use this 48h sample (hourly, two days, midday peaks) as the running example for every Prometheus signal below. The `total-usage` signal sums each series into one value:

![Grafana-style time-series panel over 48 hours: img-A peaks midday both days, img-B smaller; x-axis is hour of day, each series summed to one value.](/images/prometheus-sampling.svg)

| Series | Pattern | sum | rank |
|--------|---------|-----|------|
| img-A | midday peaks, low at night | 30 | 1 |
| img-B | small midday bumps | 12 | 2 |

| Field | Controls | Default |
|-------|----------|---------|
| `queryType` | `range` = window of samples · `instant` = one point now | `range` |
| `lookback` | how far back the window reaches (ignored for `instant`) | — |
| `step` | spacing between samples; smaller = more points, heavier query | `5m` |

Field semantics: [`DiscoveryPrometheusQuery`](https://github.com/Breee/puller/blob/main/api/v1alpha1/discoverypolicy_types.go).

### Loki Query

```yaml
apiVersion: drop.corewire.io/v1alpha1
kind: DiscoveryPolicy
metadata:
  name: loki-query-example
spec:
  syncInterval: 1h
  maxImages: 30
  queries:
    - name: image-pull-events    # referenced by eventPullTime signal
      type: loki
      loki:
        endpoint: https://loki.example.com
        queryType: range         # only supported Loki query mode currently
        lookback: 168h
        query: |
          # Successful pulls carry pull duration and image size in the message.
          {job="kubernetes-events", namespace="gitlab-runner"}
          | json
          | involvedObject_name =~ "runner-.*"
          | reason = "Pulled"
        parser:
          type: kubernetesEvents # maps log fields into structured event records
          podField: involvedObject_name  # which field holds the pod name
          reasonField: reason            # only Pulled events are consumed
          messageField: message          # free-text event message
          imageField: message            # image ref is extracted from the message
  signals:
    - name: avg-cold-pull-time
      query: image-pull-events
      type: eventPullTime
      eventPullTime:
        metric: pullTime       # default; aggregates pull duration samples
        statistic: avg          # mean pull duration per image
  ranking:
    strategy: signal
    signal: avg-cold-pull-time   # slowest images rank highest
```

How it's used: Loki contributes pull lifecycle data, not usage volume. The
`kubernetesEvents` parser turns each `Pulled` event into a structured record
with `podField`, `reasonField`, and `messageField`, then extracts the image
from `imageField` (typically the same message text).

Alloy shipping (real cluster events):
- Use
  [`loki.source.kubernetes_events`](https://grafana.com/docs/alloy/latest/reference/components/loki/loki.source.kubernetes_events/)
  forwarding to
  [`loki.write`](https://grafana.com/docs/alloy/latest/reference/components/loki/loki.write/).
- With `log_format: json`, Alloy emits keys like `name`, `reason`, `msg` in the
  log body. Default labels are `namespace`, `job`, `instance`.
- Parser mapping for Alloy JSON should be `podField: name`,
  `reasonField: reason`, `messageField: msg`, `imageField: msg`.
- Raw event-exporter JSON usually uses `involvedObject_name` + `message`.

#### What happens to our query

Loki returns streams, each with `[timestamp, line]` entries. With Alloy
`log_format: json`, each line is a JSON event:

```json
{
  "stream": {"job": "kubelet", "namespace": "default"},
  "values": [
    ["1719400000000000000", "{\"reason\":\"Pulling\",\"name\":\"runner-1\",\"msg\":\"Pulling image \\\"docker.io/library/redis:7-alpine\\\"\"}"],
    ["1719400002000000000", "{\"reason\":\"Pulled\",\"name\":\"runner-1\",\"msg\":\"Successfully pulled image \\\"docker.io/library/redis:7-alpine\\\" in 704ms\"}"]
  ]
}
```

The parser extracts image + size from each `Pulled` entry, then builds per-image samples:

| Parsed event | Output key | Value added |
|-------------|------------|-------------|
| `Pulled ... in 704ms` | `docker.io/library/redis:7-alpine` | `0.704` seconds |
| `Pulled ... Image size: N bytes` | `docker.io/library/redis:7-alpine:size_bytes` | `N` |

For `eventPullTime` signals, these samples are reduced by `statistic`
(`avg`/`p50`/`p95`/etc.) into one value per image.

### Registry Query

```yaml
apiVersion: drop.corewire.io/v1alpha1
kind: DiscoveryPolicy
metadata:
  name: registry-query-example
spec:
  syncInterval: 1h
  maxImages: 30
  queries:
    - name: registry-tags
      type: registry
      registry:
        url: https://registry.gitlab.com
        repositories:           # repos to enumerate tags from
          - gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/gitlab-runner-helper
        tagFilter: "^x86_64-v[0-9]+\\."  # only x86_64-v1. / x86_64-v2. ...
        versionPattern: "x86_64-v(.+)"  # capture group 1 is the version
        tagSeek: "x86_64-u~"    # skip straight to the x86_64-v* tags
        maxScan: 2000           # cap tags fetched per repo before filtering
        topX: 3                 # keep the 3 newest matching tags per repo
        imageTemplate: "{{.Registry}}/{{.Repository}}:{{.Tag}}"  # built image ref
      secretRef:
        name: registry-api-creds   # registry auth Secret in the operator namespace
```

No `signals` or `ranking` are needed: registry queries already return their
tags newest-first, so the discovered images come out pre-ranked.

How it's used: registry discovery lists tags per repository via
`/v2/<repo>/tags/list`, applies `tagFilter`, sorts newest-first, keeps `topX`,
then renders full image references via `imageTemplate`.

Important behavior notes:
- `tagFilter` is regex on tag names. Anchor explicitly (`^...$`) when needed.
- Tags are sorted by version descending (newest first). Strict semver tags work
  out of the box; prefixed/suffixed tags (e.g. GitLab runner helper
  `x86_64-v17.5.0`) are handled by extracting an embedded semver substring.
  Tags with no parseable version fall back to registry push order. `topX` then
  keeps the newest N.
- `versionPattern` (optional) is a regex with one capture group that pins where
  the version lives in the tag, e.g. `x86_64-v(.+)` for GitLab helper images.
  Use it when the default extraction picks the wrong number.
- `tagSeek` (optional) is a pagination cursor sent to the registry as the `last`
  query parameter. The registry lists tags lexically after this value, so you
  can skip large numbers of irrelevant earlier tags (e.g. tens of thousands of
  digest tags) without fetching them. It is not a real tag name — any string
  works, e.g. `x86_64-u~` jumps straight to the `x86_64-v*` tags.
- `maxScan` (optional) caps how many tags are fetched per repository before
  filtering. Defaults to `1000`. Pair it with `tagSeek` to fetch only the
  relevant range on registries with very large tag lists.
- `imageTemplate` variables: `{{.Registry}}`, `{{.Repository}}`, `{{.Tag}}`.
  Default: `{{.Registry}}/{{.Repository}}:{{.Tag}}`.

Signal fit:
- Registry queries are self-ranking; `signals`/`ranking` are optional and
  ignored for ordering. Aggregation signals are a no-op (one sample per tag).
- Not compatible with `timeWeightedAggregate`/`windowAggregate`/`eventPullTime`
  (tag snapshots are not time series).

#### What happens to our query

For each repository, the controller calls `/v2/<repo>/tags/list`, then applies
`tagFilter`, `topX`, and `imageTemplate`.

Example registry payload:

```json
{"name":"gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/gitlab-runner-helper","tags":["x86_64-v17.3.0","x86_64-v17.4.0","x86_64-latest","x86_64-v17.5.0","x86_64-v17.10.0"]}
```

With `tagFilter: "^x86_64-v[0-9]+\\."`, `versionPattern: "x86_64-v(.+)"`, and
`topX: 3`, the newest kept tags are:

| Repository | Matching tags | Kept (`topX=3`) | Rendered images |
|-----------|----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| `gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/gitlab-runner-helper` | `x86_64-v17.3.0`, `x86_64-v17.4.0`, `x86_64-v17.5.0`, `x86_64-v17.10.0` | `x86_64-v17.10.0`, `x86_64-v17.5.0`, `x86_64-v17.4.0` | `registry.gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/gitlab-runner-helper:x86_64-v17.10.0` ... `:x86_64-v17.4.0` |

Note `x86_64-v17.10.0` correctly ranks above `x86_64-v17.5.0` (version-aware,
not lexical), and the non-versioned `x86_64-latest` tag is excluded by
`tagFilter`. Images come out newest-first, so no ranking is required.

### Auth / TLS

Both query types support a `secretRef` for authentication and TLS:

```yaml
apiVersion: drop.corewire.io/v1alpha1
kind: DiscoveryPolicy
metadata:
  name: query-auth-example
spec:
  syncInterval: 1h
  maxImages: 30
  queries:
    - name: runner-image-usage
      type: prometheus
      prometheus:
        endpoint: https://mimir.example.com
        query: ...
      secretRef:
        name: prometheus-creds  # Secret in the operator namespace (typically drop-system)
  signals:
    - name: total-usage
      query: runner-image-usage
      type: aggregate
      aggregate:
        method: sum
  ranking:
    strategy: signal
    signal: total-usage
```
Supported Secret keys: `token`, `username`, `password`, `ca.crt`, `tls.crt`, `tls.key`, `headers.<name>`.

## Stage 2 — Signals

A signal derives a named per-image value from exactly one query. The four types reduce the same panel differently:

| Type | Reduces to | Key knobs |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| `aggregate` | One value over all samples | `method`: sum/max/avg/count/min |
| `timeWeightedAggregate` | Weighted sum by hour-of-day | `windows`, `weight`, `timezone` |
| `windowAggregate` | One sub-window only | `relativeWindow` or `window` start/end |
| `eventPullTime` | Event metric statistic | `metric`: pullTime/imageSize, `statistic`: p50/p90/p95/avg/max/count |

Signal × source compatibility:

| Signal type | Prometheus | Loki | Registry |
|-------------|------------|------|----------|
| `aggregate` | yes | yes | no-op |
| `timeWeightedAggregate` | yes | yes | no |
| `windowAggregate` | yes | yes | no |
| `eventPullTime` | no | yes (`kubernetesEvents`) | no |

Registry queries return tag snapshots, not time series, so time-windowed signals are intentionally rejected. They are already self-ranked newest-first, so `aggregate` adds nothing and signals/ranking can be omitted entirely.

All Prometheus examples below run on this 48h dataset (sampled every 6h, both days identical):

| Series | 00 | 06 | 12 | 18 | sum/day | 48h total |
|--------|----|----|----|----|---------|-----------|
| img-A | 2 | 3 | 6 | 4 | 15 | 30 |
| img-B | 0 | 1 | 3 | 2 | 6 | 12 |

> The graphics use **6h buckets** (dots mark each sample) to fit the page; real queries sample every `step` (e.g. 1m). The shapes and totals match the math, not the true resolution.

### `aggregate`

Aggregates all samples per image using a single method. The `method` you pick
changes what "wins" — same data, different score:

{{< tabs items="sum,count,avg,max,min" >}}

{{< tab >}}
![sum adds every sample in the lookback window into one value per image.](/images/signal-aggregate-sum.svg)
{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab >}}
![count is the number of samples per image, regardless of value.](/images/signal-aggregate-count.svg)
{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab >}}
![avg is the mean sample value, shown as a horizontal line per image.](/images/signal-aggregate-avg.svg)
{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab >}}
![max keeps only the single highest sample per image.](/images/signal-aggregate-max.svg)
{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab >}}
![min keeps only the single lowest sample per image.](/images/signal-aggregate-min.svg)
{{< /tab >}}

{{< /tabs >}}

On the shared dataset, `sum` makes total volume win regardless of *when* it
happened: img-A → 30, img-B → 12.

| `method` | Reduces to | img-A | img-B | Best for |
|----------|-----------|-------|-------|----------|
| `sum` | Total of all samples | 30 | 12 | total activity / volume |
| `max` | Largest single sample | 6 | 3 | peak concurrency / bursts |
| `avg` | Mean across samples | 3.8 | 1.5 | typical load |
| `min` | Smallest single sample | 2 | 0 | always-on baseline |
| `count` | Number of samples | 8 | 8 | how often it was seen |

```yaml
apiVersion: drop.corewire.io/v1alpha1
kind: DiscoveryPolicy
metadata:
  name: aggregate-signal-example
spec:
  syncInterval: 1h
  maxImages: 30
  queries:
    - name: runner-image-usage
      type: prometheus
      prometheus:
        endpoint: https://mimir.example.com
        queryType: range
        lookback: 168h
        step: 1m
        query: count(container_memory_working_set_bytes{container!="",container!="POD"}) by (image)
  signals:
    - name: total-usage
      query: runner-image-usage
      type: aggregate
      aggregate:
        method: sum    # sum | max | avg | count | min (sum = total activity)

    - name: peak-concurrency
      query: runner-image-usage
      type: aggregate
      aggregate:
        method: max             # captures burst behavior
  ranking:
    strategy: signal
    signal: total-usage
```

### `timeWeightedAggregate`

Multiplies each sample value by a per-hour window weight before aggregation.

![timeWeightedAggregate scales each time band by its weight (e.g. core hours ×1.0, off-hours ×0.3) then sums.](/images/signal-timeweighted.svg)

On the shared dataset: midday bars (×1.0) keep full value, shoulder bars (×0.3) shrink, off-hours (×0) vanish. img-A keeps most of its 30 because its peaks land in core hours; img-B fades further. Business-hour usage outranks 24h volume.

| Window | Hours | `weight` | img-A keeps | img-B keeps |
|--------|-------|----------|-------------|-------------|
| warm-up | 07–09 | 0.3 | shoulder bars ×0.3 | shoulder bars ×0.3 |
| core | 09–17 | 1.0 | midday peak full | midday peak full |
| taper | 17–20 | 0.3 | evening ×0.3 | evening ×0.3 |
| off | else | 0 (`defaultWeight`) | dropped | dropped |
| **total** | | | **≈ 21** | **≈ 8** |

`method` accepts sum/count/avg/max/min, but `sum` is the only one that meaningfully uses the weights.

```yaml
apiVersion: drop.corewire.io/v1alpha1
kind: DiscoveryPolicy
metadata:
  name: time-weighted-signal-example
spec:
  syncInterval: 1h
  maxImages: 30
  queries:

        queryType: range
        lookback: 168h
        step: 1m
        query: count(container_memory_working_set_bytes{container!="",container!="POD"}) by (image)
  signals:
    - name: developer-weighted-usage
      query: runner-image-usage
      type: timeWeightedAggregate
      timeWeightedAggregate:
        method: sum
        timezone: Europe/Berlin # evaluate windows in local business time
        defaultWeight: "0"     # hours not listed below contribute nothing
        windows:                # weight = how much each hour-of-day counts
          - startHour: 7
            endHour: 9
            weight: "0.3"     # warm-up window = 0.3×
          - startHour: 9
            endHour: 17
            weight: "1.0"     # core hours = full weight
          - startHour: 17
            endHour: 20
            weight: "0.3"     # taper period = 0.3×
  ranking:
    strategy: signal
    signal: developer-weighted-usage
```

### `windowAggregate`

Aggregates only the samples within a specific time sub-window. There are two
ways to pick the window, and only one may be set per signal:

![windowAggregate keeps only samples inside one sub-window (e.g. 09:00–17:00) and sums them.](/images/signal-windowaggregate.svg)

On the shared dataset: only the shaded 09:00–17:00 band counts; bars outside it are dropped before summing. img-A ≈ 6 (its 12:00 peak), img-B ≈ 3. Everything outside the window is invisible — sharper than weighting.

| Setting | Window | img-A | img-B | Use when |
|---------|--------|-------|-------|----------|
| `relativeWindow: 2h` | last 2h from now | 4 | 2 | "what is hot right now" |
| `window` 00:00–09:00 | off-hours | 5 | 1 | overnight / batch jobs |
| `window` 09:00–17:00 | core hours | 6 | 3 | protect active workday |

`method` accepts sum/count/avg/max/min (default sum). Set **either** `relativeWindow` **or** `window`+`timezone` — never both.

- `relativeWindow` — "the last N hours from now", measured in UTC. No timezone needed.
- `window` — fixed clock hours of the day (e.g. 09:00–17:00). You **must** also set
  `timezone`; those hours are read in that zone. The policy errors if it is missing.

### `eventPullTime`

Derives image pull-time statistics from Loki event records. The kubelet emits a `Pulled` event for every image pull; each event carries the pull duration. Drop collects all `Pulled` events for each image within the lookback window and treats them as the sample set.

![Each dot is one Pulled event. x = when within the lookback window, y = how long it took. redis:7 has a slow outlier at 4100 ms (slow link on that node); nginx:1.25 is consistently around 750 ms.](/images/signal-eventpulltime-events.svg)

The `statistic` field reduces these samples to one ranking value per image. Slower images rank higher:

{{< tabs items="p50,p90,p95,avg,max,count" >}}

{{< tab >}}
![p50: dashed line = median. Half the nginx pulls were faster than 750 ms; half the redis pulls were faster than 700 ms. The 4100 ms outlier does not move the p50.](/images/signal-eventpulltime-p50.svg)
{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab >}}
![p90: dashed line = 90th percentile. 9 out of 10 nginx pulls were under 796 ms. For redis the tail starts to show: 3420 ms (the outlier weighs more with only 3 samples).](/images/signal-eventpulltime-p90.svg)
{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab >}}
![p95: dashed line = 95th percentile. Strict worst-case tail. redis p95 = 3760 ms.](/images/signal-eventpulltime-p95.svg)
{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab >}}
![avg: dashed line = mean. The 4100 ms outlier pulls the redis mean up to 1830 ms, well above the p50 of 700 ms. The mean is sensitive to a single slow pull.](/images/signal-eventpulltime-avg.svg)
{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab >}}
![max: ringed dot = the slowest pull per image. redis max = 4100 ms; nginx max = 820 ms.](/images/signal-eventpulltime-max.svg)
{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab >}}
![count: ringed dots = all observed pull events. nginx = 5 events, redis = 3 events.](/images/signal-eventpulltime-count.svg)
{{< /tab >}}

{{< /tabs >}}

Pick `p50` as the default: it ranks by typical pull latency and is robust to a single slow outlier. Use `p90`/`p95` when SLO tail latency matters, `max` for strict worst-case provisioning.

| `statistic` | Reduces to | nginx (5 events) | redis (3 events) | Best for |
|-------------|-----------|-------|-------|----------|
| `p50` | median pull | 750 | 700 | typical latency, robust to outliers |
| `p90` | slow tail | 796 | 3420 | worst-case planning |
| `p95` | slower tail | 808 | 3760 | strict SLOs |
| `avg` | mean pull | 746 | 1830 | overall cost (skewed by outliers) |
| `max` | slowest pull | 820 | 4100 | absolute worst pull |
| `count` | cold-pull events | 5 | 3 | how often pulled cold |

`eventPullTime` uses `metric + statistic`, both derived from `Pulled` events:
- `metric: pullTime` (default) with `statistic: p50|p90|p95|avg|max|count`
- `metric: imageSize` with `statistic: p50|p90|p95|avg|max|count` (bytes from `Image size: N bytes`)

Rank by image size (bytes) from the same Pulled events:

```yaml
signals:
  - name: avg-image-size
    query: image-pull-events
    type: eventPullTime
    eventPullTime:
      metric: imageSize
      statistic: avg

ranking:
  strategy: signal
  signal: avg-image-size
```

## Stage 3 — Ranking

Exactly one ranking strategy per policy.

![Decision map for ranking strategy selection: use signal for one dominant metric, weightedSum for balancing known trade-offs, and modelExposure for minimizing cold-node impact in rotating clusters.](/images/ranking-decision-map.svg)

![The three ranking strategies side by side: signal orders by a single signal, weightedSum blends normalized signals, and modelExposure models post-rotation cold-node exposure.](/images/ranking-strategies.svg)

### `signal`

Ranks images directly by the value of a single signal.

```yaml
apiVersion: drop.corewire.io/v1alpha1
kind: DiscoveryPolicy
metadata:
  name: signal-ranking-example
spec:
  syncInterval: 1h
  maxImages: 30
  queries:
    - name: runner-image-usage

        queryType: range
        lookback: 168h
        step: 1m
        query: count(container_memory_working_set_bytes{container!="",container!="POD"}) by (image)
  signals:
    - name: total-usage
      query: runner-image-usage
      type: aggregate
      aggregate:
        method: sum
  ranking:
    strategy: signal
    signal: total-usage    # simplest strategy: sort by one signal
```

### `weightedSum`

**Definition.** Blends several signals into one score by normalizing each to `[0,1]` and summing them with per-signal weights. Use it when no single signal decides — e.g. balance steady usage against burst peaks.

$$
\mathrm{final\_score}(I) = \sum_k w_k \cdot \mathrm{normalize}(s_k(I)), \qquad
\mathrm{minMax}(x) = \frac{x - x_{\min}}{x_{\max} - x_{\min}}
$$

      terms:                 # weights are fractions, should sum to ~1.0
        - signal: total-usage
          weight: "0.7"      # 70% importance
        - signal: peak-concurrency

```

      targetWindowUsageSignal: target-window-usage # usage during peak window to protect
      pullTimeSignal: avg-cold-pull-time # colder/slower pulls get higher urgency
```

Score formula:

$$
\mathrm{score}(I) = J_{\mathrm{target}}(I) \cdot \left(1 - \frac{1}{N}\right)^{J_{\mathrm{pre}}(I)} \cdot \hat{p}(I)

## Status and Observability

Status records query execution outcomes and the final ordered image list used by
`CachedImageSet`.

```yaml
status:
  lastSyncTime: "2026-06-18T10:00:00Z"
  imageCount: 2

  conditions:
    - type: Ready
      status: "True"
      reason: Synced
      message: "Discovered 2 images."

  queryResults:
    - name: runner-image-usage
      type: prometheus
      status: success         # success | failed (message set on failure)

  discoveredImages:
    - image: registry.example.com/ci/java-gradle:21
      rank: 1
      finalScore: "0.8768"
    - image: registry.example.com/ci/node:20
      rank: 2
      finalScore: "0.5210"
```

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `conditions[Ready]` | `reason=Synced` once the pipeline runs successfully; `message` summarizes the result |
| `imageCount` | Number of discovered images (also a print column) |
| `queryResults[]` | Per-query `name` · `type` · `status` · `message` (on failure) |
| `discoveredImages[]` | Ordered result: `image` · `rank` (1 = highest) · `finalScore` |

## Discovery Strategies Reference

| # | Strategy | Score formula | Signals needed |
|---|----------|---------------|----------------|
| 1 | Total usage | `Σ count_I(t)` over W | `total-usage` |
| 2 | Peak same-image concurrency | `max count_I(t)` over W | `peak-concurrency` |
| 3 | Developer-time weighted usage | `Σ weight(t)·count_I(t)` | `developer-weighted-usage` |
| 4 | Recent usage | `Σ count_I(t)` over recent window | `recent-usage` |
| 5 | Hybrid usage + peak | `α·norm(total) + (1-α)·norm(peak)` | `total-usage`, `peak-concurrency` |
| 6 | Hybrid dev-time + peak | `α·norm(dev) + (1-α)·norm(peak)` | `developer-weighted-usage`, `peak-concurrency` |
| 7 | Count × pull time | `total_usage(I) · p_hat(I)` | `total-usage`, `avg-cold-pull-time` |
| 8 | Model-aware exposure | `J_target · (1-1/N)^J_pre · p_hat` | `pre-window-usage`, `target-window-usage`, `avg-cold-pull-time` |

## Error Handling

- On transient failures, the operator keeps the **last known good** discovery results
- Source health is tracked via conditions on the DiscoveryPolicy status
- Each query is executed independently — one failing query does not block others
